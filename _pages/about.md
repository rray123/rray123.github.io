I am a fourth-year PhD student at the Department of Statistics at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Cynthia Rush](https://www.columbia.edu/~cgr2130/) and [Marco Avella Medina](https://sites.google.com/site/marcoavellamedina/home?authuser=1). I received my BS/MS in Statistics and Data Science at Yale University.

I am primarily interested in robust and reliable statistical inference. My specific focus has been on
* **Robust Bayesian methods under model misspecification**: I am interested in establishing frequentist asymptotic guarantees for Bayesian methods that are "robust" to misspecification of the likelihood or model. See my recent work [here]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07900)) and here on posterior tempering, one such method.
* **Variational Inference**: I am interested in establishing similar guarantees for variational approximations of Bayesian posteriors.
* **Differential Privacy**: I am interested in establishing accuracy and statistical guarantees for statistics released under differential privacy constraints. I am also interested in developing methods for privacy-preserving data analysis where individuals require different levels of privacy.
